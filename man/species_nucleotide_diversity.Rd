\arguments{
\item{specimen.df}{a data.frame of specimen}

\item{sequenceIntersectSites}{a matrix of presence/absence TRUE/FALSE of a specimen within a site
with column as site ID
and row as specimen spatial points ID}

\item{MinimumNumberOfSequencesBySpecies}{an integer minimum number of sequences representatives of a species in a site}

\value{
a dataframe with taxonomy and nucleotide diversity and number of sequences by species
species with not enough sequences to calculate nucleotide diversity are removed
}
